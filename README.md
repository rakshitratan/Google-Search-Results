                        Collecting Google search results and scraping websites URLs for Sentiment Analysis:

   For very a long time I was looking for APIs that could help me to figure out a way to get the URLs of a google search page along
   with its descriptions. I tried many but was not fascinated by any. So, I used the basic web scraping library to automate the task.


So, in this article I have uploaded three files:

•	Google Search Result Part_1: In this Jupiter notebook you will find the process of Scraping google for title, URLs and descriptions. 
   Then we will create a data frame so that we can import that into an excel or csv file.

•	Google Search Result Part_2: In this Jupiter notebook we will use the same method as the previous file, 
   but we will customize the search URL for time period.

•	Google Search Result Part_3: We will continue with the same file to perform Sentiment analysis of the description collected
   from the search.
